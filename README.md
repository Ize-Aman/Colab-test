# Delivery Management System

This is a Java-based Delivery Management System developed by our group. The system includes an Admin and Customer side, a login page, and is connected to a database hosted on a local computer using Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS).

## Features

- **Admin Panel**: Manage orders, deliveries, and customer details.
- **Customer Interface**: Place orders.
- **Authentication System**: Secure login for both admins and customers.
- **Database Integration**: Connected with Microsoft SQL Server for data storage and retrieval.
